# 🚦 Traffic Optimization Using Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithms

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **quantum-classical hybrid algorithms**, specifically the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**, to optimize **traffic congestion** and **green-light timings**. The goal is to minimize traffic build-up through quantum circuit-based optimization, laying the foundation for more advanced traffic management solutions.

While currently focused on data-driven optimization, this project serves as a **starting point for scaling to real-world scenarios**, with potential future integration of **constraints, real-time data, and machine learning models**.
